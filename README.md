# Afterglow

Afterglow is a minimal dark Theme for Sublime Text 2 and 3. Also it is a syntax color scheme. The theme is based on the great theme [Spacegray](https://github.com/kkga/spacegray). The syntax color scheme is mostly derived from [idlefingers](http://idlefingers.co.uk/).

**Originally designed** by [@YabataDesign](https://github.com/YabataDesign). I composed it with theme [Spacegray](https://github.com/kkga/spacegray) and theme [itg.flat](https://github.com/itsthatguy/theme-itg-flat). And icons come from [Seti_UI](https://github.com/ctf0/Seti_ST3).

**Special thanks** to Max Riveiro [@kavu](https://github.com/kavu) for add a lot of icons for sidebar to this repository.
